# NBA-Playoff-Prediction-Model
NBA-Playoff-Prediction-Model is an AI-driven machine learning pipeline designed to forecast NBA playoff outcomes by combining structured data, natural language processing, and large language models. The system integrates season statistics, player performance metrics, and box scores with real-time news data sourced via APIs, enriching traditional quantitative features with context-aware insights. Multiple regression and classification models were trained and evaluated, with the final ensemble achieving 81% predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.83), representing a 12% improvement over baseline models. Beyond prediction, the pipeline leverages LLMs to generate natural-language explanations of matchup dynamics, making the results interpretable and engaging for end users. The workflow is deployed in a Streamlit dashboard that displays calibrated win probabilities, matchup breakdowns, and AI-generated narratives, providing a comprehensive and interactive tool for basketball analytics.
